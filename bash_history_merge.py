""" Merge multiple `.bash_history` files and deduplicate their content.

Produces a consolidated output on STDOUT with all entries sorted by timestamps.

During the deduplication process, historized command lines are normalized by
stripping their leading and trailing blank characters. Empty history entries
will be ignored.

Are considered duplicate entries those sharing the exact same timestamp and
normalized command line.

Timestamp-less entries will be set to epoch. And their natural order will be
preserved. On deduplication, only the last occurence will be kept.

Requires the `boltons` python module, installable via `pip`:
Timestamp-less entries will be set to epoch.

  $ pip install boltons

Usage example:

  $ python bash_history_merge.py "~/.bash_history" ".histcopy" > .merged_hist

TODO: Add option to deduplicate lines, whatever their timestamp, by only
keeping the lastest occurence.
